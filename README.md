# My Piano

piano.py, when run, opens a program that simulates a two-octave piano.

## Versioning Notes

This used to work in both Python 2 AND 3, but since then, the `simpleaudio` module seems to only be supported for Python 3.

## Getting Started

1. `cd src`
2. `pip3 install simpleaudio`
3. `python3 piano.py`

## How to Play

To play the piano through keys on the keyboard, Z - M are the first octave white keys, and holding shift while pressing Z - M will play the second octave white keys. In the row of keys A - L, the keys that fall in between the "white" keys where the "black" keys would normally be are the sharp and flat keys. For example, because the key Z is the note C, the key S is the note C#.
